# TSCAH

TSCAH is a bot designed to allow users to play Cards Against Humanity over text chat on 
TeamSpeak servers. Cards Against Humanity is more fun when you can talk to other people, and 
integrating it with TeamSpeak chat is an easy way to be able to manage the game while 
communicating with other players!

TSCAH is written in (hastily-written) Python. Refactoring is fairly high up on the priorities 
list.

## Use
1. Create a ServerQuery account for the bot. Most default permission sets are fine.
2. `python tscah.py <host> <username> <password> <channelid>`
3. Type `help` in the channel the bot is in for a command list.

## Contributing
Feel free to fix any of the below listed bugs and send a pull request. I check Github daily 
typically. I'll eventually move this to the formal issues system.

- Fix CPU leak (probably some infinite loop or another) when left running for long periods
- Clean up edge cases (and some non-edge cases) for players joining and quitting while in-game
- Add support for multi-pick cards
- Add more cards
- Add [gambling](http://s3.amazonaws.com/cah/CAH_Rules.pdf) support
- Clean up code (and document!)
- Add support for choosing different ports

### Notes on Naming
I'm legally obligated to tell you that TSCAH merely stands for TSCAH: an arbitrary ordering 
of letters with no affiliation with any trademark holders. 
Therefore, in all official documentation, it shall be referred to as TSCAH. 
Any expanded form of the name TSCAH is invalid.
